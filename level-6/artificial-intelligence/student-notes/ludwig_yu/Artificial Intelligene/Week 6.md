## Robot Scientist

## The concept of a Robot Scientist

An AI system capable of carrying out cycles of scientific experimentation. Ross D. King and others have demonstrated that it is possible to automate the scientific process.

An robot scientist is a system that can generate a hypothesis, design experiments, carry out the experiments and analyze the results.

Science is based onthe hypothetico-deductive method

## Motivation for robot scientists

Technological advance:
the production of data outnumbers the production of knowledge

Open science

Not enough scientist

## History

### Dendral and Meta-Dendral

developed in the 1960s at Stanford University.
help organic chemists in identifying unknown organic molecules
Heuristic Dendral, performance system, Meta Dendral, learning system

### Bacon

Rediscovering physics and chemistry

### Adam

Adam generate and confirm novel functional-genomics hypotheses about the identify of genes encoding enzymes catalysing orphan reactions in the metabolicnetwork of the yeast

Adam's conclusions have been manually verified

It was the first machine to autonomously discover novel scientific knowledge: hypothesise, and experimentally confirm

### Eve

Drug design for tropical diseases
Background knowlege: graphs and standard chemoinformatic methods
Hypotheses generation: induction

### Gensis

able to execute 10000 closed loop cycles of experiment in parallel. Equivalent to 1000 biologists.
ability to automatically design, plan and execute the thousands of experiments and improve a very complex systems biology model

## Roboethics

Roboethics covers ehtical issues related to robot design, operation and use.
Can we design robots to act ethically?
How people should treat robots, and how should robots treat people?
Should robots have rights?
Who or what is responsible if a robot or other automated system causes harm?
Are there any risks to create emotional bonds with robots?
Which type of ehical codes is correct for robots and automated systems?
